# Shielding Data from Cyber Threats: Leveraging Image Steganography with Cryptography for Safe Internet Communication
# ABSTRACT:
The internet has become an essential part of our lives, and with its increased usage, the risk of cyber threats has also increased manifold. Cyber threats such as data theft, hacking, and cyber-attacks have become a significant concern for organizations and individuals alike. Various techniques such as cryptography, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems have been developed and implemented to counter these threats. However, with the advancement of technology, these techniques have proven to be inadequate in protecting data from cyber threats. In recent years, image steganography has gained significant attention as a potential solution to safeguard data from cyber threats. Image steganography is a technique that involves hiding data within an image, making it indiscernible to unauthorized users. The hidden data can then be transmitted over the internet without fear of being intercepted by attackers. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages image steganography with cryptography to shield data from cyber threats. The proposed approach involves two main steps: hiding data within an image using image steganography and encrypting the hidden data using a symmetric key algorithm.
# PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
The paper proposes using image steganography as a more secure mechanism for hiding messages than cryptography alone. While cryptography is relatively easy to cryptanalyze, steganography allows messages to be hidden in carriers such as pictures, making them less detectable and more secure. The authors implement image steganography using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique, which involves embedding data within the least significant bit of selected pixels in an image. This technique provides a secure and efficient way to transfer sensitive data over the internet, which is particularly important given the security challenges posed by cryptography. Overall, the use of image steganography with the LSB technique is presented as a viable solution to ensure secure internet communication.
# AIM AND OBJECTIVES 
The aim of "Shielding Data from Cyber Threats: Leveraging Image Steganography with Cryptography for Safe Internet Communication" is to propose a comprehensive approach for secure internet communication by combining image steganography with cryptography. The objectives include providing an overview of internet security and the limitations of existing methods, describing the LSB technique for image steganography and symmetric key cryptography, providing a practical implementation using Python, and evaluating the performance in terms of security and efficiency. The paper aims to provide a more secure and efficient way of transmitting sensitive data over the internet using the proposed approach.
# THE PROPOSED SYSTEM
The proposed system, "Shielding Data from Cyber Threats: Leveraging Image Steganography with Cryptography for Safe Internet Communication," is a secure communication system that combines image steganography with the least significant bit (LSB) technique to protect data from cyber threats. The system will have two main components: the sender's side and the receiver's side.
At the sender's side, the user will input the message to be transmitted. The system will encrypt the message using a secure encryption algorithm such as AES or RSA, to protect it during transmission. The encrypted message will then be hidden inside an image using steganography with the LSB technique. The LSB technique will ensure that the message is hidden in the least significant bits of the image, making it difficult for an attacker to detect.
At the receiver's side, the user will retrieve the image file and use a decryption key to decrypt the hidden message. The decryption key will be generated by the system during the encryption process and will be unique to each message. The user will enter the decryption key into the system, and the system will use it to decrypt the message.
The proposed system will use Python programming language and open-source libraries for steganography and cryptography. The system will also have a graphical user interface (GUI) to make it easy for non-technical users to use.
The system will offer the following advantages:
Enhanced data security: The combination of steganography and cryptography will ensure that the message is hidden and protected during transmission, reducing the risk of cyber-attacks.
Resistance to image analysis techniques: The LSB technique will ensure that the message is hidden in the least significant bits of the image, making it difficult for an attacker to detect.
Customizable encryption: The system will use a secure encryption algorithm, and the user will have the flexibility to choose the level of encryption depending on the sensitivity of the data.
User-friendly interface: The GUI will make it easy for non-technical users to use the system, improving its accessibility.
Overall, the proposed system will be a significant contribution to the field of internet security, providing a new approach to safeguarding sensitive data during transmission. The system will be beneficial for individuals, businesses, and government organizations that need to transmit sensitive information over the internet.
# SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
The system architecture proposed in the paper "Shielding Data from Cyber Threats: Leveraging Image Steganography with Cryptography for Safe Internet Communication" involves a combination of image steganography and cryptography techniques to ensure secure communication over the internet. The system architecture can be divided into the following components:

Data Encryption: The sender encrypts the secret data using a strong encryption algorithm to protect it from unauthorised access during transmission.
Image Selection: The sender selects a cover image that will be used to hide the secret data.
LSB Algorithm: The sender applies the LSB algorithm to modify the least significant bits of the pixel values in the cover image to embed the encrypted secret data.
Key Generation: The sender generates a key for the encrypted data and transmits it to the receiver using a separate channel.
Transmission: The modified image file with embedded encrypted data is transmitted over the internet to the receiver.
Image Reception: The receiver receives the modified image file from the sender.
LSB Algorithm: The receiver applies the LSB algorithm to extract the least significant bits of the pixel values in the modified image file to obtain the embedded encrypted data.
Key Decryption: The receiver decrypts the key using a shared secret key or a public key encryption algorithm to obtain the key for decrypting the embedded data.
Data Decryption: The receiver uses the key to decrypt the embedded data to recover the original data.
It is important to note that the use of both steganography and cryptography techniques provides an extra layer of security to protect the data being transmitted over the internet. By combining these techniques, an attacker would need to defeat both the encryption and steganography methods to obtain the secret data, which significantly increases the difficulty of a successful attack.
